# Bruno RNS - Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio, built with Django. It showcases my skills, projects, and contact information, and features a contact form that sends notifications via GitHub issues for me.

> It is based on [developer portfolio - of hhhrrrttt222111](https://github.com/hhhrrrttt222111/developer-portfolio). This repository gives a more complete template, it was made to run in node.js but I have adapted it to run in django context.

## Features

- **Modern Django Web App**: Built with Django 5, using best practices for security and performance.
- **Skills & Projects Showcase**: Displays my technical skills and selected projects with descriptions and links.
- **Contact Form**: Visitors can send messages directly from the site; messages are sent as GitHub issues for notification.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.
