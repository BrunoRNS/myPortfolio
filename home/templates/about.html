I'm Bruno Rian Nunes de Souza, a passionate software developer and student from Cascavel, PR, Brazil. Currently pursuing an <b>Integrated IT Course</b> at the Federal Institute of Paran√°, I specialize in building efficient, well-documented solutions across diverse domains.
<br><br>
Driven by my love for video games since childhood (especially 90s classics like Sonic and Mario), I create community-focused open-source tools while exploring unconventional domains like <b>SNES development</b> and <b>music production</b>. My work balances technical rigor with creative expression - from algorithm design to guitar compositions.
<br><br>
Always seeking new challenges, I thrive on transforming complex problems into organized solutions while actively contributing to open-source communities.
